# Zade's Perfect Biscuts

To make this recipe easy to scale, I specify ingredient quantaites as a ratio.

for the basis of this recipe.

## Ingredients

Ratio of 1:2:2 butter:sugar:flour.

- 1 Butter (soffened)
- 2 Sugar
- 2 Flour (regular white)
- 2 Eggs per half block (250g) of butter
- Vanlla (optional)
- Dark chocolate (optional) (use Whitaker's)

> **Example**
>
> 250g of butter means 500g flour, 500g sugar, and 2 eggs.
>
> This will make about 26 biscuts.

The butter can be melted for easier mixing or browned if you like.

You can mix and match different types of sugar as long as the total matches the
ratio—brown sugar for fudginess and caster/icing sugar for softness. I tend to
avoid regular white sugar because sometimes you can still notice the texture
once it's cooked, but it works perfectly fine otherwise.

## Method

Preheat oven to 200°C.

Mix all the ingredients together. It's easier if you melt the butter.

If you want chocholate chip biscuts, smash up some dark chocholate and mix it
in.

I also recomend adding a dash of Vanilla for flavour.

You can shape them however you like - I roll them into 3-4cm diameter balls and
then squash them with a fork. Make sure to space them out on the tray because
they will grow a little in the oven.

Place onto a baking tray with baking paper.

Fan bake at 200°C for 15-20 minutes until they're how you like them.

Leave to harden for a few minutes before devouring.
