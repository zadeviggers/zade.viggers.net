# Fancy tabs

## INTRODUCTION

Most tabs suck. They work, but they're ugly. Here's an example:

<Tabs client:load tabs={tabs} boring />

These tabs are functional. Obiously in a real senario you'd style them a tad
prettier, but that is effectivley what they'd look like. Or you might opt for an
underline instead, like Google does:

<Tabs client:load tabs={tabs} boring underlined />

## The problem

These tabs are unsatisfying, boring, and look like they're from
[Bootstrap 1.0](https://getbootstrap.com/1.0.0/#navigation), which came out in

<HowManyYearsAgo date={new Date("August 19 2011")} />.

Tabs that look like this make me sad. They make your designers sad. They make
your users sad. They make you sad.

## The solution

Make the tabs fun! Make the background (or underline) move when the user chanegs
tab, rather than teleporting it.

<Tabs client:load tabs={tabs} />

<Tabs client:load tabs={tabs} underlined />

It looks scary, but it's not actually that bad to implement. All you have to do
in your javascript is set a `left` and `width` value on an indicator element
using inline styles.

```ts
// This example is slightly simplified but it works.

// Get the dimentions of the container element that holds the tab buttons.
const containerRect = tabButtonsContainerElement.getBoundingClientRect();

// Call this when a tab is clicked
function updateIndicator(activeTabButton: HTMLElement) {
	// Get the dimentions of the button
	const buttonRect = activeTabButton.getBoundingClientRect();

	// Change the indicator's width to match the button
	indicator.style.width = buttonRect.width + "px";

	// Change the left-offset of the indicator to that of the button minus the parent's left-offset.
	// This is to account for things like padding on the body.
	indicator.style.left = buttonRect.left - containerRect.left + "px";
}
```

Then we can let CSS handle all of the animations, and disable them when a user
requests reduced motion.

```css
.tabs {
	width: 100%;
	position: relative;
}

.tab {
	padding: 12px;
	background-color: transparent;
	color: black;
	text-align: center;
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: center;
	border-radius: 8px;
}
.tab:hover {
	background-color: #efefef;
}

.indicator {
	position: absolute;
	bottom: 0;
	height: 2px;
	background-color: black;
	transition-duration: 200ms;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion) {
	.indicator {
		transition-duration: 0;
	}
}
```

## But what about React/Vue/Solid/whatever??!?!

Yeah, if you're using a framework it gets a tad more complicated, because you
have to deal with _refs_ and stuff.

Here's a Solid example:

```tsx
import {
	createEffect,
	createSignal,
	For,
	Show,
	createUniqueId,
} from "solid-js";
import "../styles/fancy-tabs.css";

export default function BoringTabs({
	tabs = { a: "b" },
	defaultTab,
	boring = false,
	underlined,
}: {
	tabs: Record<string, string>;
	defaultTab?: string;
	boring?: boolean;
	underlined?: boolean;
}) {
	const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = createSignal<keyof typeof tabs>(
		defaultTab || Object.keys(tabs)[0],
	);
	const [tabControlsRef, setTabControlsRef] = createSignal<
		HTMLDivElement | undefined
	>();
	const [tabsButtonsRefs, setTabsRefs] = createSignal<
		Record<string, HTMLElement | undefined>
	>({});
	const [indicator, setIndicator] = createSignal<HTMLSpanElement | undefined>();

	const tabControlsRect = () => tabControlsRef()?.getBoundingClientRect();
	const activeButtonRef = () => tabsButtonsRefs()[activeTab()];
	const id = createUniqueId();

	createEffect(() => {
		if (!boring && indicator() && activeButtonRef() && tabControlsRect()) {
			const activeButtonRect = activeButtonRef().getBoundingClientRect();
			console.log(activeButtonRect);
			indicator().style.left =
				activeButtonRect.left - tabControlsRect().left + "px";
			indicator().style.width = activeButtonRect.width + "px";
		}
	});

	return (
		<div
			class={`${boring ? "boring" : "fancy"} ${
				underlined ? "underlined" : "background"
			} tabs`}>
			<div
				class="tabs-controls"
				role="tablist"
				aria-label="Tabs"
				ref={setTabControlsRef}>
				<For each={Object.keys(tabs)}>
					{(key) => (
						<button
							id={`${id}-tab-button-${key}`}
							role="tab"
							ref={(el) =>
								setTabsRefs((oldRefs) => ({ ...oldRefs, [key]: el }))
							}
							class={activeTab() == key && "active"}
							aria-selected={activeTab() == key ? "true" : "false"}
							aria-controls={`${id}-tab-panel-${key}`}
							onClick={() => setActiveTab(key)}>
							{key}
						</button>
					)}
				</For>
				<Show when={!boring}>
					<span class="tabs-indicator" ref={setIndicator}></span>
				</Show>
			</div>

			<For each={Object.entries(tabs)}>
				{([key, value]) => (
					<div
						role="tabpanel"
						id={`${id}-tab-panel-${key}`}
						class="tabs-panel"
						style={{ display: activeTab() === key ? "block" : "none" }}>
						{value}
					</div>
				)}
			</For>
		</div>
	);
}
```

(I got lazy and just copied and pasted the component that I made to use in this
article which is kinda ugly and bad, but it should still show you the gist of
it).

Also, if you're using React (not sure if this applies to other frameworks or
not), and you're changing the width of the tab button when it's active, by
bolding the text inside it or something, you'll want to use `useLayoutEffect`
instead of regular `useEffect` for updating the indicator so that the calculated
width and offset are correct.

## Extra for ~~experts~~ nerds

If you're feeling very fancy, you can also try copying Vercel's tabs and have
the indicator follow your cursor, snapping to the closest tab button, which is
also a very nice effect.

## Conclusion

Please make your tabs less boring. It's 2022 and most of the tabs out there look
like they're from 2011. It's not hard. Your users will love you for it. It will
multiply your dating prospects by 100x (although 100 times 0 is still 0...)
